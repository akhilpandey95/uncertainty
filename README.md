# ANL Summer 2020 research

## About
The repository consists of information assosicated with the research on uncertainity quantification for graph neural network architectures. This work was part of an internship at [ANL](https://www.anl.gov/mcs) in the Mathematics and Computer Sciences (MCS) division. The repository has 5 directories:
- `literature/` - Summaries of all the scholarly articles that are read through the course of the project.
- `src/` - Code, documentation, and essential information about the models built for the project.
- `scripts/` - Essential scripts necessary for setting up the project.
- `tests/` - Deterministic unit tests for better replication of the results.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebook(s) with sample code showcasing how to utilize the resources of the project.

## Branches & Labels
The repository follows an issue based approach to commit code/doc/information. The following
are the branches that exist in the repository.
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Instance</th>
      <th>Branch</th>
      <th>Description, Instructions, Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Stable</td>
      <td>stable</td>
      <td>Accepts merges from Working and Hotfixes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Working</td>
      <td>master</td>
      <td>Accepts merges from Features/Issues and Hotfixes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Features/Issues</td>
      <td>iss-XX-/L-XYZ</td>
      <td>Always branch off HEAD of Working</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hotfix</td>
      <td>hotfix-*</td>
      <td>Always branch off Stable</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Labels created are associated with the branch names so that every Feature/Issue can be
traced to a specific source. Here is a quick legend to illustrate the branch names:
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Branch</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
      <th>Description, Instructions, Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>iss-XX/L-del</td>
      <td>Delete</td>
      <td>Remove a document, feature, class or function from the repository </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>iss-XX/L-doc</td>
      <td>Documentation</td>
      <td>Improvements or additions to documentation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>iss-XX/L-upd</td>
      <td>Update</td>
      <td>Update an existing document, feature, class or function in the project</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>iss-XX/L-enh</td>
      <td>Enhancement</td>
      <td>Add a document, feature, class or function to the project</td>
    </tr>
