## Branches & Labels
The repository follows an issue based approach to commit code/doc/information. The following
are the branches that exist in the repository.
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Instance</th>
      <th>Branch</th>
      <th>Description, Instructions, Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Stable</td>
      <td>stable</td>
      <td>Accepts merges from Working and Hotfixes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Working</td>
      <td>master</td>
      <td>Accepts merges from Features/Issues and Hotfixes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Features/Issues</td>
      <td>iss-XX-/L-XYZ</td>
      <td>Always branch off HEAD of Working</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hotfix</td>
      <td>hotfix-*</td>
      <td>Always branch off Stable</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Labels created are associated with the branch names so that every Feature/Issue can be
traced to a specific source. Here is a quick legend to illustrate the branch names:
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>

      <th>Description, Instructions, Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>iss-XX/L-del</td>
      <td>Delete</td>
      <td>Remove a document, feature, class or function from the repository </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
